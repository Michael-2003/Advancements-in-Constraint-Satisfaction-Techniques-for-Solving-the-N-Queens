The N-Queens problem is a well-known puzzle in computer science and 
mathematics. It involves placing N queens on an N*N chessboard in such a way that no two 
queens can attack each other. Solving the N-Queens problem is not only of recreational 
interest but also holds significance in the domain of constraint satisfaction and optimization 
algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and analysis of advancements 
in constraint satisfaction techniques for solving the N-Queens problem.

One of the fundamental techniques used in constraint satisfaction, 
backtracking, is explored in detail. Backtracking algorithms incrementally build and explore 
partial solutions, backtracking when a constraint violation occurs. The efficiency of 
backtracking algorithms in solving the N-Queens problem is discussed, along with 
optimizations and variations proposed to improve its performance.
